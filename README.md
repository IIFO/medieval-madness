# Medieval Madness
This is a little text adventure game I have made in Ruby to practice the language. I know the title is a bit lame. 

I still have to upgrade a few things like:

  - Improve story (make it longer and more interesting)
  - Add more posibilities
  - Enhace fights (maybe add some sort of timing)
  - Maybe add a main menu.

Sorry my English is not perfect, it is not my first language.
